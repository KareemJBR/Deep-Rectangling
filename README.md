## Project Description

In this work we are trying to improve the results of a recent work: https://github.com/nie-lang/DeepRectangling.

We are creating augmentations in different ways for each image in the input dataset, this way we are training our model on a much bigger dataset with a good chance for better accuracy.

## Requirements:

During our work, we had our code on:

- Windows 10 64-bit
- Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650
- CUDA 10.1

In addition, we had many essential Python packages and dependencies for running the code that you can find in the env.yaml file.
